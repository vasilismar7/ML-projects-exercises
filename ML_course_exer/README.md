## Machine Learning course programming exercise

1) Implement the Perceptron algorithm. Use it on the iris dataset to determine whether some class 
   is linearly separable from the rest. (Perceptron_iris.ipynb)

1) Implement the k-NN, Bayes and Naive Bayes models and compare them for the "pima indians diabetes" dataset,
   using K-Fold cross validation. (knn_bayes_pima.ipynb)
